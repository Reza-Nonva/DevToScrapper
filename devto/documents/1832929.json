    "body": "E-commerce is a huge part of today's internet and Tailwind CSS has been a growing CSS framework that more and more developers are adopting. I'd like to share with you a couple of customer service pages that we've coded over at Flowbite. Get started with a collection of components and pages to show questions and answers to your E-commerce customers with FAQ and community forums. Default customer service page Use this component to show a list of question and a form where you can submit a question within a modal to provide support to customers. Source code and example Customer service with drawer This example can be used to show both questions and answers and use a drawer with a form element that allows you to add a question. Source code and example Customer service accordion with FAQ Use this example to show a list of frequently asked questions and answers inside an accordion component for your e-commerce customers. Source code and example Customer service with wysiwyg Use this example to show a list of questions and answers with upvotes and a wysiwyg form to submit an answer as a product customer.
